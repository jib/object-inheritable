* Description

Object::Inheritable

    Object::Inheritable lets you inherit data between objects that use
    Object::Inheritable as a baseclass (or other objects that implement
    a similar API), by defining a relationship between these objects. 
    
    This works analogous to C<perl>s own @ISA resolving, but rather 
    than on classes, it works on objects.

* Installation

Object::Inheritable follows the standard perl module install process

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The module uses no C or XS parts, so no c-compiler is required.
